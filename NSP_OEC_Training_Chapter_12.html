<h2 id="121-list-and-describe-the-four-ways-a-drug-enters-and-moves-through-the-body">12.1: List and describe the four ways a drug enters and moves through the body.</h2>
<p>The process by which a drug enters and moves through the body is known as <strong>pharmacokinetics</strong> and is commonly described by four stages: <strong>absorption</strong>, <strong>distribution</strong>, <strong>metabolism</strong>, and <strong>excretion</strong>. These stages determine how quickly and efficiently a drug works, how long it lasts, and how it is ultimately cleared from the body.</p>
<h3 id="1-absorption">1. <strong>Absorption</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Absorption refers to the process by which a drug enters the bloodstream from its site of administration (e.g., oral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal). For a drug to be effective, it must be absorbed into the bloodstream, except in cases of local administration (e.g., topical treatments).</li>
<li><strong>Factors affecting absorption</strong>: The <strong>route of administration</strong>, the <strong>drug formulation</strong>, and <strong>physiological factors</strong> (like pH and gastrointestinal function) all play a role in absorption. For example, oral drugs must pass through the stomach and intestines before entering the bloodstream, which can delay absorption.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A medication taken orally must dissolve in the stomach and be absorbed in the intestines before it reaches the bloodstream.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-distribution">2. <strong>Distribution</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Once a drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is distributed throughout the body to tissues and organs. The drug must reach its target tissues to exert its intended effects.</li>
<li><strong>Factors affecting distribution</strong>: Blood flow to tissues, the <strong>drug's solubility</strong>, its ability to bind to plasma proteins, and the presence of barriers (e.g., the <strong>blood-brain barrier</strong>) determine how a drug is distributed. Drugs that are more lipid-soluble or unbound to proteins tend to distribute more widely.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A drug that crosses the blood-brain barrier will affect the central nervous system, like some sedatives or painkillers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-metabolism">3. <strong>Metabolism</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Metabolism refers to the chemical alteration of a drug, typically in the <strong>liver</strong>, to make it easier for the body to excrete. This process can transform active drugs into inactive forms or convert prodrugs (inactive forms) into active forms.</li>
<li><strong>Factors affecting metabolism</strong>: The <strong>liver enzymes</strong> involved in metabolism (such as the <strong>cytochrome P450 enzymes</strong>) are a major factor. Additionally, age, genetic factors, liver function, and interactions with other drugs can influence how quickly a drug is metabolized.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Many drugs are metabolized in the liver to more water-soluble compounds, which are easier to excrete via the kidneys.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-excretion">4. <strong>Excretion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Excretion is the process by which the body eliminates the drug or its metabolites, primarily through the <strong>kidneys (urine)</strong> but also through the <strong>liver (bile)</strong>, <strong>lungs (exhaled air)</strong>, or <strong>skin (sweat)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Factors affecting excretion</strong>: Kidney function, hydration status, and the drug's chemical properties affect how efficiently it is excreted. Drugs that are not properly metabolized or excreted may accumulate in the body, leading to toxicity.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Most medications are filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Drugs like antibiotics and some blood pressure medications are eliminated this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a drug’s journey through the body—absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion—determines how it exerts its effects and is ultimately cleared. Understanding these stages helps in optimizing drug therapy and managing drug interactions and side effects. </p>

<h2 id="122-list-the-four-routes-of-absorption">12.2: List the four routes of absorption.</h2>
<p>The <strong>four main routes of absorption</strong> refer to the different ways drugs enter the body and are absorbed into the bloodstream. Each route has its unique characteristics, advantages, and challenges:</p>
<h3 id="1-oral-enteral-absorption">1. <strong>Oral (Enteral) Absorption</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Drugs are taken by mouth and absorbed through the digestive tract.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: This is the most common route of administration. The drug passes through the stomach and intestines, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Tablets, capsules, and liquid medications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-intravenous-iv-absorption">2. <strong>Intravenous (IV) Absorption</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Drugs are directly injected into the bloodstream.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: This route bypasses the absorption process since the drug is delivered directly into the circulatory system, leading to <strong>immediate</strong> and <strong>complete absorption</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: IV fluids, chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-inhalation-absorption">3. <strong>Inhalation Absorption</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Drugs are absorbed via the lungs when inhaled as a gas or aerosol.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: This route provides rapid absorption due to the large surface area of the alveoli in the lungs and the rich blood supply.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Inhalers for asthma (e.g., albuterol) or anesthetic gases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-topicaltransdermal-absorption">4. <strong>Topical/Transdermal Absorption</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Drugs are applied to the skin and absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin layers.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Absorption through the skin is generally slower and provides a <strong>sustained release</strong> of the medication.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Patches (e.g., nicotine patches), ointments, and creams.</li>
</ul>
<p>These routes determine how quickly and effectively a drug is absorbed and used by the body, and the choice of route often depends on the specific drug and the condition being treated.</p>

<h2 id="127-define-sludgem-and-dumbels-in-the-context-of-poisoning">12.7: Define SLUDGEM and DUMBELS in the context of poisoning.</h2>
<p><strong>SLUDGEM</strong> and <strong>DUMBELS</strong> are two mnemonics used by healthcare providers and emergency responders to remember the signs and symptoms of <strong>cholinergic poisoning</strong>, which can occur from exposure to organophosphates, certain chemical warfare agents (e.g., sarin gas), and pesticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to excessive stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<h3 id="sludgem"><strong>SLUDGEM</strong>:</h3>
<p>This mnemonic is used to describe the <strong>muscarinic</strong> effects of cholinergic poisoning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>S</strong> – <strong>Salivation</strong>: Excessive production of saliva.</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> – <strong>Lacrimation</strong>: Excessive tearing or watery eyes.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong> – <strong>Urination</strong>: Involuntary or frequent urination.</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> – <strong>Defecation/Diarrhea</strong>: Involuntary bowel movements or diarrhea.</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> – <strong>Gastrointestinal upset</strong>: Abdominal cramping, nausea, or vomiting.</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> – <strong>Emesis</strong>: Vomiting.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> – <strong>Miosis</strong>: Pinpoint pupils (constricted pupils), a classic sign of organophosphate or nerve agent exposure.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dumbels"><strong>DUMBELS</strong>:</h3>
<p>This mnemonic is used similarly to describe the <strong>muscarinic</strong> and some <strong>nicotinic</strong> effects of cholinergic poisoning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>D</strong> – <strong>Defecation/Diarrhea</strong>: Involuntary bowel movements or diarrhea.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong> – <strong>Urination</strong>: Involuntary or frequent urination.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> – <strong>Miosis</strong>: Pinpoint pupils (constricted pupils).</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> – <strong>Bradycardia</strong>: Abnormally slow heart rate.</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> – <strong>Emesis</strong>: Vomiting.</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> – <strong>Lacrimation</strong>: Excessive tearing.</li>
<li><strong>S</strong> – <strong>Salivation</strong>: Excessive production of saliva, leading to drooling.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="application"><strong>Application</strong>:</h3>
<p>These mnemonics are crucial for identifying <strong>organophosphate poisoning</strong> or <strong>nerve agent exposure</strong>, which require urgent medical intervention, typically including the use of <strong>atropine</strong> (an anticholinergic agent) and <strong>pralidoxime</strong> (to reactivate acetylcholinesterase). Early recognition of these symptoms helps guide rapid treatment to prevent respiratory failure and other life-threatening complications.</p>
